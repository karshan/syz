This package contains the generic zipper system described in:

 Scrap Your Zippers: A Generic Zipper for Heterogeneous Types.
 Michael D. Adams.  WGP '10: Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGPLAN
 workshop on Generic programming, 2010.

It defines the Zipper type permitting zipper traversals over arbitrary
instances of Data.  See the paper for an introduction on using it.

The paper is available at:

While the core zipper data structures are quite solid, the surrounding
library design is likely to change based on feedback from the
community.  So if you find any bugs or would like to see something
changed, please let me know.
